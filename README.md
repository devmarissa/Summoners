# Summoners Game Investment Proposal
This document will outline the details of the Summoners game and the requested funding goal for supporting Alpha development.

### Game Summary
Summoners is a high-fantasy RPG where players explore a large and varied world to collect summoning books that expand their abilities. Summoned entities each have unique properties and an array of abilities that players can use in both PVE and PVP combat. Each summon is tied to the player's karmic level, ranging from negative to positive, meaning that every decision a player makes will lead them further down their chosen path.


# Game Mechanics
This section will list all of the main mechanics of Summoners in detail and how they will be implemented into Alpha.

## Guilds
Players will be able to start their own guilds of their chosen class depending on their karmic alignment.

## Karma
Summoners mainly revolves around the theme of the duality between good and evil. The actions you take in the game will either positively or negatively impact your karmic level, and depending on your goals, this can be good or bad for you. All entities and artifacts will require a specific range of karma in order to be able to summon or use them.

### Karmic Levels
There is a dynamic range of karma a player can earn.

### Positive Karmic Actions
- Completing ethical quests
- Killing hostile NPCs
- Killing members of the same karmic alignment

### Negative Karmic Actions
- Completing unethical quests
- Killing friendly NPCs
- Killing members of the same karmic alignment


## Summoning
In order to get entities to fight for you and your guild in combat, you need to complete a summoning ritual according to the entities' summoning book.
### Ritual
The books you find on quests throughout Inamorta will outline a specific ritual you need to excecute either alone or with your guild, depending on the requirements.
- Artifacts required for higher level entities
- Multiple players required for higher level entities
- Ritual duration will vary based on the power of the entity

### Time/Weather/Location Specific Rituals
Certain high-karma level entities will require specific times and weather conditions to summon them to limit overpowered summons in the game.


## Quests
Quests are given by friendly NPCs who will give a task for the player to complete. Quests will give various rewards, either by finding a summoning book or getting rewarded karma.
