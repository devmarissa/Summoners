# Summoners Game Investment Proposal
This document will outline the details of the Summoners game and the requested funding goal for supporting Alpha development.

## Game Summary
Summoners is a high-fantasy RPG where players explore a large and varied world to collect summoning books that expand their abilities. Summoned entities each have unique properties and an array of abilities that players can use in both PVE and PVP combat. Each summon is tied to the player's karmic level, ranging from negative to positive, meaning that every decision a player makes will lead them further down their chosen path.


# Game Mechanics

## Guilds
Players will be able to start their own guilds of their chosen class depending on their karmic alignment.

## Karma
Summoners mainly revolves around the theme of the duality between good and evil. The actions you take in the game will either positively or negatively impact your karmic level, and depending on your goals, this can be good or bad for you. All entities and artifacts will require a specific range of karma in order to be able to summon or use them.

### Positive Karmic Actions
